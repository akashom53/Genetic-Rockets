# Genetic Rockets

[Click here to see it in action!](https://akashom53.github.io/Genetic-Rockets/)
This is a javascript applet works on genetic evolution algorithms.

  - Rockets are generated with initially random paths
  - Based on distance from the target, crashing, goal achieving, and time taken, each rocket gets a fitness score.
  - After each lifespan (250 cycles), the old popuation dies and a new population is created from the gennome of the old population.
  - Rockets with higher fitness have higher probablilty of reproducing.

### Future scope

  - Write better fitness function to evolver faster path
  - Make better information representation
  - Add intelligence (neural nets?) to individual rockets so as to ensure individual learning as well as population evolution.
